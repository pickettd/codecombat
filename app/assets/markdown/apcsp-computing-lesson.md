# Computing Lesson Project
Research Activity, Computational Artifact Activity

### AP Computer Science Principles: Learning Objectives:
- [LO 1.2.4] Collaborate in the creation of computational artifacts. [P6]
- [LO 2.1.1] Describe the variety of abstractions used to represent data. [P3]
- [LO 2.3.1] Use models and simulations to represent phenomena. [P3]

## What is a computing lesson?
A computing lesson is a computational artifact that teaches others about a computing concept. In this project, students will create artifacts to teach others about a concept of their choice. They will work in pairs and develop ways to represent their chosen concept to an audience with a limited knowledge of computing.

### What you need: 
Computers - one for each pair of students

Throughout Unit 2, the students will learn about computing concepts and the basis of computational thinking. For an end of unit assessment, students will work in pairs to create a computational artifact that teaches others about one of the computing concepts covered in Unit 2. Students should assume that the artifact will be consumed by others who do not have much computational knowledge. Thus the students should focus on using simple language and analogies that will be relatable to their audience.

The students may choose both the topic of their computational artifact as well as the intended audience.  For example, they may choose to teach elementary school students about different number systems or grandparents about computer storage hardware. The students must work together to choose a topic and audience, plan the computational artifact, identify a model or simulation to represent the topic, and create the computational artifact. Each student pair will present their artifact to the class. Each student should also provide a written response to some or all of the assessment questions below.

This lesson will take four days - one day for planning the lesson, two days for designing and creating the artifact, and one day for presentations, discussion, and reflection. 

### Discussion Questions:
- Describe how you and your partner collaborated to create the computational artifact.
- How does your model/simulation represent the topic you chose to teach others about? How well does it model the phenomenon? What aspects are not modeled well?
- Why did you choose the model you did? How does it fit the intended audience?

### Assessment Questions:
- Pick a portion of your lesson that you and your partner collaborated on. How does this reflect effort from both of you? [EK 1.2.4A]
- While collaborating on this lesson, was there a time when you and your partner disagreed? How did you resolve this disagreement? [EK 1.2.4C]
- What is a portion of the lesson which reflects different perspectives from you and your partner? [EK 1.2.4F]
- How does your model simplify what it represents? [EK 2.3.1A]
- What is something that your model omits? What are the tradeoffs for not including this aspect in your model? [EK 2.3.1C]
