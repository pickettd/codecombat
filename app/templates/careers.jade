      h3 iOS at CodeCombat

      .big-text
        p Want to write the first iPad app for CodeCombat?  We’re looking for a product-focused engineer to translate our core gameplay and educational tools into an experience that feels like it was born on the iPad.

        p Building a great iPad experience is important to CodeCombat because many classrooms are using iPads instead of desktops with their students.  It’s essential that we bring CodeCombat to those students as well.

        p We’re looking for someone who is well-versed in iOS development, has a strong understanding of good UX, and isn’t afraid to get their hands dirty in the backend code.

    p CodeCombat is changing how kids learn computer science, using real programming languages to explore an adventure game.  Students start with simple function calls to move a hero and before long they’re writing functions to send archers to the eastern defenses.

    p Our teacher tools allow CodeCombat to create classroom experiences which are awesome and effective.
